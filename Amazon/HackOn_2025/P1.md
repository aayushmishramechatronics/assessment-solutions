# Problem:
You are given a string which represents a rope, where each character in the string corresponds to a 1 meter segment of rope. 
The length of rope is 'N'. Each segment of the rope can either have a knot ('2') or no knot ('1').
You are also given an integer 'K'. You have to fold the rope K times. 
In each fold, divide the rope into two equal parts and reverse the second half, then overlay the two parts by summing corresponding segments.
After folding K times, determine the strength of each segment in the resulting rope.
A knot ('2') contributes strength of 2 and a plain segment ('1') contributes 1.

# Input Format:
1) First line: Two space-separated integers 'N' and 'K' (length of the rope and number of folds)
2) Second line: A string of length N containing only '1's and '2's

# Output Format:
Output an array of space-separated integers representing the strength of each segment in the final rope

# Constraints:
1) 1 <= N <= 10^6
2) 0 <= K <= log2(N)

# Sample Testcase 1:
