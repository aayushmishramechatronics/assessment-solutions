# Problem:
You are given a string which represents a rope, where each character in the string corresponds to a 1 meter segment of rope. The length of rope is 'N' Each segment of the rope can either have a knot which is represented by a '2' in the string or no knot which is represented by a '1:

You are also given an integer 'K: You have to fold the rope K times. In each fold you have to divide the rope into two equal parts and reverse the other half, then overlay the two parts on top of each other.

After folding the rope 'K' times, your task is to determine the strength of each segment in the resulting rope. The strength of a segment is defined by the sum ofmail all the overlaid segment values at that position, where a knot ('2') has a strength of 2 and no knot ('1') has a strength of 1.

Example:
Rope = "12211212"
1) First fold = "1221" & "2121" = -> Strength = 3 3 4 2 
2) Second fold = "12" & "21" & "12" & "12" = -> Strength = 5 7

# Input Format:
1) First line: Two space-separated integers 'N' and 'K' (length of the rope and number of folds)
2) Second line: A string of length N containing only '1's and '2's

# Output Format:
Output an array of space-separated integers representing the strength of each segment in the final rope

# Constraints:
1) 1 <= N <= 10^6
2) 0 <= K <= log2(N)

# Sample Testcase 1:
# Input:
```
8 2
12212121
```
# Output:
```
5 7
```
# Sample Testcase 2:
# Input:
```
4 1
1221
```
# Output:
```
2 4
```
